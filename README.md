# Web-Projects Repository

This repo will contain future web projects I plan to work on involving building interactive websites by using and learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and more.


## Current Projects

* html-css-course: Follow through guide on SuperSimpleDev's "HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro" video. This course teaches the basics of using HTML and CSS to build an interactive website by dividing it into specific lessons with exercises to do at the end of each lesson. Then, these lessons were all combined into the final project of creating an interactive Youtube Clone website.

* react-app:
